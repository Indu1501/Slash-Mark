# Detecting Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy, a serious complication of diabetes, poses a significant risk of permanent blindness if left untreated. This project endeavors to create a solution for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy utilizing machine learning methodologies.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found on Kaggle at [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data). It contains a collection of retinal images labeled with the severity of diabetic retinopathy, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.
## Objective
The primary aim of this endeavor is to construct a dependable and precise system for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. Through the application of machine learning algorithms, the objective is to aid healthcare practitioners in the timely identification and intervention, thereby mitigating the risk of vision impairment in diabetic individuals.


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Indu1501/Slash-Mark/edit/main/Diabetic%20Retinopathy%20Detection`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection`
3. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Set up your Python environment with the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
5. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data and the development process.
6. Experiment with different machine learning models and techniques for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy.
7. Refer to the source code in the `src/` directory for implementation details and customization.
